## Spirograph

Here is my attempt to implement a toy called "Spirograph" in JavaSript.

"Spirograph is a geometric drawing toy that produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids."(Wikipedia)

### Math

The Spirograph image get using a hypotrochoid. The hypotrochoid is a roulette traced by a point attached to a circle of radius r rolling around the inside of a fixed circle of radius R, where the point is a distance d from the center of the interior circle.
